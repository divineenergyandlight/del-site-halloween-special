        <p id="about-text">A little Bio about Me:<br><br>
          My name is Erica and I have been doing this work you could say since I was a child. 
          Born not of this world, my mission has always been the same. I am here to help raise the collective consciousness (I know it sounds crazy! but it's not). 
          No matter what I'm doing the mission is always the same, this path has taken me through so many initiations that have lead me through so much growth. 
          I take this work seriously and I'm constantly working through my own hurdles so that I'm capable of helping others. 
          I've had a lot of trainings to encourage the remembering of what I already know. From Metatronia, Reiki, Shamanism, Animal communication the list goes on. 
          The best training I have received has been from my own real life experiences and using my own intuition in helping others. 
          Before I tapped into Energy Healing work my way of serving was through working in the field of mental health. 
          I proceeded to get a degree Bachelor of Science in Psychology. 
          I then realized I wanted to combine the metaphysical with the knowledge I had gained not only from school but from my own healing journey 
          I was going through. Energy Medicine called me I loved how you can provide real relief to someone in need along with guidance, compassion and love. 
          If you're really committed to your own journey of expansion, my sessions will help guide you into your own authentic internal compass. 
          Im here as a channel of this Divine Energy that we all have access to but the actual healing will come from your own commitment and willingness to change. 
          There are no victims here, we take full responsibility and ownership of our lives; And so it is!</p>
